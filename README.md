NPM is a commonly used tool that allows developers to install loads of extensions to manage their projects.

Bower allows us to install frameworks and libraries, such as Bootstrap, Angular, jQuery, Foundation, and many others. 
The reason we use this tool is simply so we don’t have to go and download each of these from their respective websites. 
It’s also beneficial in that we don’t have to store all those frameworks in our repository, which saves space in the 
repository.
